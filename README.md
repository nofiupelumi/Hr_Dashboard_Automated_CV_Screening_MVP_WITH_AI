## About This Project

This is a CV screening application built with Laravel. It allows applicants to submit their CVs, which are then processed by a GitHub Action to match keywords for specific job positions....

### Running the Application

1.  **Install Dependencies:** `composer install` and `npm install`
2.  **Set up Environment:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your database. You will also need to add the following to your `.env` file:
    ```
    APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
    GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
    GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=Riskcontrol
    GITHUB_REPO_NAME=CV_Screening_Job
    ```
    
    **Important:** The GitHub token is required for CV processing. Generate a Personal Access Token with `actions:write` and `repo` permissions from GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens. The CV processing is handled by a separate GitHub Actions workflow in the `CV_Screening_Job` repository.
3.  **Run Migrations:** `php artisan migrate`
4.  **Run the Development Server:** `php artisan serve`
5.  **Run the Queue Worker:** `php artisan queue:work` (restart this after any code changes)

This project uses Laravel's queue system to process CVs in the background. The queue worker is essential for the application to function correctly. **Important:** You must restart the queue worker after making any changes to the code to ensure it's running the latest version.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## License

The Laravel framework is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Database

This project expects a MySQL-compatible database. An example `.env.example` is provided and already configured to use a local MySQL database named `hr-recruitment-dashboard`.

If you're using phpMyAdmin locally, create a database named `hr-recruitment-dashboard` (utf8mb4, collation `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`). Then copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update credentials if your MySQL user is not `root`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit the following values in .env if necessary:
# DB_USERNAME=your_mysql_user
# DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
```

Test the connection and run migrations:

```bash
composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
```

If migrations run successfully, your app is connected to the `hr-recruitment-dashboard` database. You can also verify via phpMyAdmin.

## Troubleshooting

### CV Processing Issues
If CVs remain "pending" after submission:

1. **Check queue worker is running:**
   ```bash
   php artisan queue:work --once
   ```

2. **Ensure GitHub configuration is set:**
   ```bash
   # Add to your .env file:
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
   GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=Riskcontrol
   GITHUB_REPO_NAME=CV_Screening_Job
   ```

3. **Run the diagnostic script:**
   ```bash
   ./diagnose-cv-processing.sh
   ```

See `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` and `PRODUCTION_FIX.md` for detailed guidance.
